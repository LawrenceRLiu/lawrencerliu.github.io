## ECE 239AS
### Deep Learning 2 (Spring 2024)
I was a TA for ECE 239AS, Deep Learning 2, at UCLA. The course was taught by Professor [Johnathan Kao](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/people/faculty/johnathan-kao/). The course covered advanced topics in deep learning, including generative models, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning. I created from scratch two deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) projects in python for the course. The first was to implement a DQN agent to drive a racecar in a 2D environment. The second was to implement a DDPG agent to balance a inverted pendulum and double inversed pendulum.
