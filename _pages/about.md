I am a first year Masters student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UCLA. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Lin F. Yang](http://drlinyang.net/). 

My research interests are in developing novel algorithms for reducing the computational cost of training, fine-tuning, and inferencing generative models. I am also interested in applications of ML to real-world problems, such as finance and healthcare. 

I did my undergrad at UCLA as well, where I majored in Electrical Engineering. I worked with Professor [Vwani Roychowdhury](https://www.ee.ucla.edu/vwani-p-roychowdhury/) from the ECE department and Professor [Hiroki Nariai](https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/hiroki-nariai) from the UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital on a joint project leveraging ML analyze EEG signals and to improve the treatment pathways for pediatric seizure resistant epilepsy patients.

**I am applying for PhD programs for Fall 2026** If you are a professor or a PhD student and you are interested in my research, please feel free to reach out to me at [lawrencerliu@ucla.edu].

My resume is available [here](assets/pdf/Resume.pdf).
